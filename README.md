### ***Data-Viz-World-cup***

This project focuses on the analysis of Argentina's national football team's performance during the FIFA World Cup. Using the dataset `Fifa_world_cup_matches.csv`, we delve into various match aspects to answer the question: "Why did Argentina win the World Cup?".

### Analysis Points

1. **Goals Scored and Goals Conceded Ratio**:
    - Investigation of the correlation between the number of matches played and the number of goals scored.
    - Analysis of goals conceded in relation to the number of matches played. It is observed that it's challenging to pinpoint a direct correlation between the two. However, a significant similarity among the top-performing teams is that they conceded very few goals during the group stages. Teams that let in more than 5 goals during the group phase were all eliminated.

2. **Ball Possession and Successful Passes**:
    - Analysis to determine whether Argentina favored a ball possession strategy or prioritized swift attacks towards the goal.

3. **Aggressiveness and Card Counts**:
    - Exploration of the relationship between aggressiveness, the number of fouls committed, cards received, and goals scored.
    - It's evident that Argentina committed more fouls than other teams, showcasing their heightened aggressiveness. This aggressiveness may have contributed to their success, highlighting a possible mindset that they wanted the win more than their adversaries. 
    - However, heightened aggression can also lead to an increase in yellow cards. Argentina received more yellow cards than most teams, but interestingly, no Argentinian player was suspended. This indicates that referees might have been more lenient, not handing out as many yellow cards as one might expect.

4. **Substitution Management**:
    - Evaluation of the effect of substitution management on team performance.

5. **Shots Analysis**:
    - Study of shots, whether they originated from inside or outside the box, and whether they were on target or not.

### Key Findings

- Teams reaching the finals are generally the ones that scored the most goals. There's a clear correlation between the number of matches played and the number of goals scored.
- Aggressiveness played a part in success, as evident by the number of fouls Argentina committed compared to other teams. 

### Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main language used for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for interactive analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization (based on visualizations observed in the notebook).
